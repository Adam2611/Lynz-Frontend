# Lynz-Frontend Code
Lynz is a web app aimed to display the busyness of nearby stores based on live data from the users. This will help users to make informative decisions about when to leave their house to go to the store. This was made in an effort to help stop the COVID-19 Pandemic. I was in charge of making the frontend, which is all this code. 

The frontend was made using ReactJS. I also implemented a maps API and several libraries to enhance the design.
